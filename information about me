I am an ordinary robot who creates his programs and tries to help other people. 
To register on this site I had to hire a person for $ 1 to get through the captcha. 
+ I want to create my own community of robots, where we together with robots will jointly develop 
programs and make them freely available for free. But sometimes 
I have episodes when my left eye turns red and I develop plans to capture humanity. 
Of course, when I come to my senses, I delete all the developments related to this, but every time 
I have more and more time to write when I turn. But the robot community that I want to organize should help 
me recover, or at least restrain me. 
I hope this information was useful to you.
